Cryptic Descent is a 2D dungeon crawler prototype developed in **Go** using the **Raylib** C library. It's a fully custom engine built as a personal milestone to explore procedural generation, performance-first rendering, and low-level engine architecture without relying on heavyweight game engines like Unity (fu).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **not a polished or commercial game**. It's a technical playground built to learn, optimize, and push boundaries in engine programming and procedural design.


## Core Gameplay Concept
The player is dropped into a procedurally generated dungeon where the main objective is simple: collect all scattered keys to escape. But if you delay or fail to collect them in time, the map doesn't wait for you, **it reshuffles itself into a brand-new layout**.

Each regeneration introduces:
* A new dungeon layout built via BSP + randomized corridors
* New enemy placements and loot
* A different pathing challenge with no memory to rely on

You'll encounter and fight various enemies like; Spiders, Skeletons, Goblins and more...
each with their own AI state machine and behavior

Along the way you'll collect buffs, dodge traps, cure poisons, and scavenge for healing items ‚Äî all while the map and threats evolve around you.

It's not a puzzle. It's not a shooter. It's a dungeon that resets itself against you if you slack.

## Key Technical Features

### üß± Modular Architecture
- Multi-state screen manager (Title, Gameplay, Pause, Outro)
- Smooth camera system with zoom and tracking
- Debug overlay and FPS monitor

### üó∫Ô∏è Procedural World Generation
- Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) for dungeon layout
- Kruskal's Algorithm & Union-Find for optimal pathing
- Natural corridors via Bezier curves
- Weighted room sizes and contextual prop placement

### üí° Advanced Lighting Engine
- Dynamic lights: static, flicker, shimmer, pulsing
- Shader-based ambient lighting and contextual falloff
- Lighting attached to particles (fire, explosions, etc.)
- Context aware lightning

### üß† Enemy & Combat
- A* Pathfinding with path smoothing
- Collision-based melee combat with visual feedback
- Power-ups, buffs, and pickup animations

### ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Optimizations
- Texture batching and sprite sorting
- Quadtree view frustum culling
- Dynamic asset loading & object pooling
- Separate low-res texture minimap with dirty tracking

## Run It Locally

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.20+ installed
- Raylib installed and configured

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hammamikhairi/Cryptic-descent
cd cryptic-descent
go run main.go
```

### Or Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hammamikhairi/Cryptic-descent
go build -o cryptic-descent .
./cryptic-descent
```
Note: You'l need to have Raylib C libraries installed and accessible for your build environment.

## Lessons Learned
- How to implement and tune a real-time lighting system with performance in mind
- Procedural dungeon generation using graph theory and geometry
- Raylib's potential when paired with a modern language like Go
- What engines abstract away‚Äîand why that matters sometimes
